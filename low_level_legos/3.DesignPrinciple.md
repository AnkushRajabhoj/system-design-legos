# Low level Design Principles

> - Program to an interface, not an implementation.
> - Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from

    what stays the same (Encapsulate what varies).

> - Favor composition over inheritance.
> - Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
> - Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## SOLID

- Single Responsibility
  -> modular class
- Open/Clone
  -> Open for extension, close for modification : safe refactor/ testing
- Liskov's Substitution
  -> Generalization : fully functional child.
- Interface Segregation
  -> cleaner minimal contract
- Dependency Inversion
  -> loosely coupled design
  -> Module should depends on abstraction

## Important

SOLID
High Cohesion and low coupling
Composition over Inheritance

## Principles

- KISS
- Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work
- Occam's razor
- Don't make me think
- Principle of Least Astonishment

- Law of Demeter

- YAGNI
- Avoid Premature Optimization

- Code For The Maintainer

- Single Responsibility
- Separation of Concerns
- Curly's Law
- High Cohesion and low coupling
- Loosely coupled
- Dependency Injection
- Inversion of Control

- DRY
- Convention over Configuration
- Composition over Inheritance

- Orthogonality
- Robustness Principle
- Hide Implementation Details
- Encapsulate What Changes

- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

- Murphy's Law : Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.
- Brooks's Law : Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
- Linus's Law : Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.

- Open/Clone
- Liskov's Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion
- Single Source of truth

- Clean code
- Boy-Scout Rule
- No broken Window
- Continuous Improvement

## Clean code (TERMS)

- Testable :
  Unit tests -> Modular | Loosely Coupled | Determinism or No Side effect
- Extensibility
- Readable
  - Error handling
  - Logs/ Tracing
- Maintainable
  - Design Pattern
- Scalability

  - Reduce footprint
  - Should work, in future with more data/user

  or

## Clean code (RSM)

- Reliable
- Scalable
- Maintainable
