## Object oriented programming

PEAI

> - Abstraction : hides complexity and implementation
> - Encapsulation : bundle data and code together
> - Polymorphism : multiple forms

    - Static (Compile Time) : Method overloading
    - Dynamic (Run time) : Method overriding

> - Inheritance

    - Interface (implements): a contract definition
    - Class (extends)

- Access modifier

  > - private (class)
  > - default (package)
  > - protected (package + subclass)
  > - public (everyone)

- Abstract
- Final
- Nested

## Basics

- Object & Class

  - Attribute (Variable)
  - Behavior (Method)

- Relationship

  - Association : any one/two way relation -> classes are related, but neither class owns the other.
    Doctor and Patient
  - Aggregation <has-a> : one object contains another object -> contained object can exist independently.
    Team and Player
  - Composition <has-a> +/ <part-of> : one object owns another object -> contained object cannot exist independently.
    Car and Engine
  - Generalization <is-a> : Inheritance
    Animal and Dog
